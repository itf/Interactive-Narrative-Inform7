Interactive-Narrative-Inform7
=============================

Text based game — Interactive narrative — Language: inform7

I'm interested in text based games and the game "The Space Under the Window", an experimental Interactive Fiction,
finalist on the XYZZY awards 1997, was really enjoyable for me.

I tried to learn how to create a game similar to that, and, since there were no extension already made with all the capabilities I wanted
I alterated the Extension interactive poetry, found on http://inform7.com/extensions/Michael%20Bacon/Interactive%20Poetry/index.html, to allow the creation of 
Interactive narratives. 

Here is my extension and part of a game I was writting. 


The original source code of my code is not accessible at the moment. I january 2014 I will recover it.
